    "# Jumbled Words\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- ### I had to start somewhere...\n",
    "\n",
    "It's a personal hobby of mine to spend a little time each day devoted to learning new things. \n",
    "For some time now, I have been meaning to get in the habit of documenting and publishing my findings, \n",
    "both to cement concepts I've learned and perhaps to help someone else who may be doing some learning of their own.\n",
    "This isn't by any means the first or the flashiest project I've worked on, but I had to start somewhere. Why not with something simple?\n",
    " -->\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "I recently came across an article talking about how people can read jumbled text, given that the first and last letters of each word remain in their respective positions. \n",
    "The article included a few examples of jumbled sentences, and I found the concept to be intriguing. Unsatisfied with example jumbled text from the article, I resolved to explore this phenomenon further. Since the format for jumbling words is both clearly defined and simple, I figured it could be the basis of a simple mini-project to brush up on my python skills. I decided to write a simple program that can take a text snippet and output a jumbled variation of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "First and foremost we should clearly define the rules of the jumbling algorithm that we want to implement, and I have done so in the short list below:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Rules of Jumbling\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first and last letter of each word must remain in place\n",
    "2. The letters in the middle of each word can be mixed up randomly in any order\n",
    "3. By default, words that are 3 letters or less remain unchanged. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the sake of simplicity, I wrote my program to ignore the puncuation and capitalization of the text that it jumbles. Doing this greatly simplifies the implementation at the cost of making the jumbled result slightly more difficult to read. Using a little extra brain power never hurt anyone, right?\n",
    "\n",
    "After doing some brief research, I chose to import a few packages to help with the processes performed in the jumbling algorithm. \n",
    "The ```random``` library will make it nice and easy to jumble the letters, and the ```re``` library helps to strip the punctuation from the imput text. Base python should be equipped with everything else we need, so let's get started on piecing things together. We'll also be using the ```argparse``` library to make our code usable from the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "I've recently come to learn that drawing a picture is a great way to start most coding projects as it provides a tentative roadmap of what needs to happen and how the different steps can be broken up. This program is simple enough that an actual sketch might not be necessary, so a simple list should suffice:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Word Jumble Program Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Read in text from a file\n",
    "2. Format the text by removing punctuation and capitalization\n",
    "3. Jumble the text according to the algorithm definition\n",
    "4. Save the jumbled text to a new file\n",
    "\n",
    "Keeping these steps in mind, we will proceed with the implementation. At the end, we'll join things up into a single script that we can run from the command line.\n"

    "To handle capitalization, we used the ```.lower()``` method from base python to make the entire content string lower case.\n",

    "\n",

    "and jumble it according to the rules that we defined earlier. \n",
    "If the word is 3 letters or less we simply add it to the output string, otherwise we jumble it!\n",
    "When jumbling, we make use of the ```sample``` function from the ```random``` library. \n",
    "The ```sample``` function takes two arguments: a population from which to sample, and the number (k) of samples to draw from that population. \n",
    "Since strings in python are treated essentially as an array of characters we can pass in ```middle``` as the population \n",
    "arguement where ```middle``` is the array remaining characters of each word after excluding the first and last characters.\n",
